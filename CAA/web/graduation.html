			<h3>Graduation Day</h3>
                       
			<p>
Graduation is getting a diploma or academic degree or the ceremony that is sometimes associated, in which students become graduates. 
Before the graduation, candidates are referred to as graduands. The date of graduation is often called graduation day. 
The graduation ceremony itself is also called commencement, convocation or invocation. In the United States and Canada, 
the term is additionally increasingly being used to refer to the advancement from a primary or secondary school level. 
When ceremonies are associated, they usually include a procession of the academic staff and candidates and a valediction. 
At the college and university level the faculty will usually wear academic dress at the formal ceremonies, as will the 
trustees and degree candidates.
			</p>
                        <p>
   "Graduation" at the college and university level occurs when the presiding officer confers degrees upon candidates, 
   either individually or en masse, even if graduates physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or 
   departmental ceremony. After degree completion, graduates can be referred to by their graduating year.
                        </p>
                        <h3>History of graduation </h3>
                        <p>Ceremonies for graduating students date from the first universities in Europe in the 12th century. At that time Latin was the language of scholarship. 
                            A "universitas" was a guild of masters (MAs) with licence to teach. "Degree" and "graduate" come from gradus, 
                            meaning "step". The first step was admission to a bachelor's degree. The second step was the masters step, giving 
                            the graduate admission to the universitas and license to teach. The typical dress for graduation are gowns and hoods 
                            or hats adapted from the daily dress of university staff in the Middle Ages, which was in turn based on the attire worn
                            by medieval clergy.</p>
